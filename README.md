#Covid-19-Analysis-SQL-Project#

#Overview#
This project is focused on analyzing Covid-19 data, including infection rates, death rates, and vaccination trends. The dataset consists of two main tables: Covid_deaths and Covid_vaccination. Through SQL queries, the project aims to uncover meaningful insights regarding the pandemic's impact on different regions and continents.

#Problem Statement:#
The goal of this project is to understand:

1.The total cases, new cases, and death rates across different locations.
2.How death rates vary by country and continent.
3.The percentage of populations infected and vaccinated.
4.Key comparisons between infection rates and vaccination progress.

#Key Analyses#
1.Infection and Death Rates: Calculated infection and death rates by location, including:

Total cases vs new cases.
Death rate percentage across countries like India.
Continent-wise highest death counts.

2.Infection Rate per Population: Analysis of the percentage of the population infected by Covid-19 across countries.

3.Global Data: Summary of total cases, deaths, and death percentages globally.

4.Vaccination Progress: Using a combination of CTEs and temporary tables to calculate rolling vaccination rates and the percentage of the population vaccinated.

#Technologies Used#
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
SQL for querying and analyzing Covid-19 data
